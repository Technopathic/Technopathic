## Everybody loves posts
Our `Post` component is essentially the container which will be displaying the full blog posts we will write. This component will have two main jobs, set the meta data in the `<head>` for each post and render our content as a child of this component.

In the `components` folder, create a new file called `Post.jsx`. 

### Post Layout
Like always, we will begin with our layout in our `Post.jsx` and we will make use of NextJS's `Head` component to set up the meta data in our blog's `<head>`.
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/16.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={16} data={data}/>

As you can see we're not only setting up the common meta data, but also OpenGraph meta data. This is useful for websites (Twitter, Discord, etc) which display a preview of any link you post to them. 

### Post styles
Our `Post` component doesn't require many styles, since many of the content styles can be included in the custom CSS file, `globals.css`. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/17.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={17} data={data}/>

We're adding styles to this `<div>` which will set our content as a `flex` layout and `flex-col` for a column direction. We are also setting a maximum width for the content so our post content does not stretch across the screen with `max-w-screen-lg`. Lastly, we set our margins to position our content in the center with additional margins at the top to add spacing between content and header. 

### Post props
Now we will set up the props for our `Post` component. We are going to receive two props to our `Post` component, which are `children` and `meta`. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/18.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={18} data={data}/>

For those of you familiar with React components, you'll know the `children` prop is anything which is inside of the component's opening and closing tags (in this case, it will be our post content). You might have already guessed it, but the `meta` prop is our post's meta data. 

Let's set up the `meta` in the head first.
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/19.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={19} data={data}/>

Here we add the meta title, description, and coverImage to our `Head` component. Keep in mind, the coverImage must be a full url to an image you want to use for your cover. Be sure to replace "http://yoursite.com" with the URL of your own site, or if you feel comfortable using environment variables, you can use those.

Let's add the `children` prop in place as well. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/20.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={20} data={data}/>

Here is the final code: 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/21.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={21} data={data}/>

That should wrap it up for all of the components we need! Now we can use them in our blog application pages.

<Divider />

## Creating our posts
We must first have a folder to store all of our posts. Inside of the `pages` folder, create a new folder named `blog`. Inside of your blog folder create a new file named `first-post.mdx`, which will contain the meta data and content of our first blog post. In the future, you will add all of your posts into the `./pages/blog` folder as `.mdx` files. 

Let's also create a folder to hold our post's images. In your `public` folder, create a new folder called `images`. In your new `images` folder, create another folder called `first-post`. We will try to keep our images organized by naming them after the title of our posts. If you have a placeholder image on hand, go ahead and place it in your `/public/images/first-post` folder with the name `cover-image.png` 

In our `first-post.mdx`, let's start by importing our `Post` component, adding and exporting the meta data, and exporting this page using our `Post` component. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/22.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={22} data={data}/>

You can change the values for title, description, date, and coverImage if you'd like, but for now let's use these as a placeholder. 

Thanks to `@next/mdx`, we can now add Markdown content to this `first-post.mdx` file and it will be exported as the `children` to the `Post` component. 

So under everything, let's add some content for our first post. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/23.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={23} data={data}/>

That should cover it for our first post. As you'd expect, these are examples, I'm sure you will create your own content when you're writing your blog posts.

Here is the final file for `first-post.mdx`
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/24.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={24} data={data}/>

<Divider />

## Getting our posts

Now that we have at least one post for our blog, we need to retrieve it from our `/pages/blog` folder and render it in the blog application. In your project root, create a file named `actions.js`.

Inside of `actions.js`, we're first going to write a function that iterates through our `.mdx` files in the `/pages/blog` folder and returns the props `link` and `module` from each of them. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/25.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={25} data={data}/>

You'll notice we're using the file name of our `.mdx` files as the link for our post pages, so it's important to *not* include spaces when naming your `.mdx` files. We're also using a bit of regex to remove the `.mdx` part of the file name to be used as a link.

Next we will use our getPosts function on the correct directory and export those files as posts. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/26.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={26} data={data}/>

That should be all for our `actions.js`! Here's the final code: 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/27.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={27} data={data}/>
