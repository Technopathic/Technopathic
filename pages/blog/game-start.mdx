# Game Start

I didn't want a website. I'm just one person and I have nothing to sell except for myself and skills. I have never needed a website to sell my skills, my experience and projects have always spoken for themselves. I've never really wanted a blog because I could never guarantee I would actually spend time writing in it.

Like many people this past year, my life has changed dramatically and my way of thinking has been shifted. I've begun to understand the importants of quality of life and my life is not my job. I love software development, but I also enjoy education and articulation. The reason this website exists is to help me put my opinions into words, to offer direction, and showcase what I'm working on or will work on. 

### What took so long

I've made personal websites for myself in the past, but I've always hit the same brick wall every time. I'm never satisified with it. So, right now I am making the conscientious decision to stick with this iteration and maintain it. There was a time where I would spend months developing my own blogging platforms so I could "call it my own", but then give up on creating a website when it became too much work. Then I would move onto using a blogging software, such as Wordpress or Ghost, but then hate it because it wasn't "mine". Currently, I'm using NextJS on a Jamstack, which feels lightweight, great, and it's mine.

I would like to use this website to suppliment my main content creation platform, which is live streaming on Twitch. Even though each post typically has a topic or theme, I don't really want to feel limited by writing about only those parameters. I want this blog to reflect the free-form atmosphere I have while live streaming.

### Plans moving forward

This is no presentation, this is my riff into what I need to do next to actually sustain myself as a content creator. For me, time is precious and I enjoy being as efficient with as little overhead as possible. New logo, color scheme, website, these are all finished. The reality is, I just need to start streaming and growing my community. 



My goal isn't necessarily to be a tutorial channel. I won't tell you what to use nor will I show you a step-by-step way to use any sort of tool, framework, or coding language. There are plenty of those already on Youtube and elsewhere. I don't want to teach you how to be a developer, I want to show you what I do as a developer. I want to be able to bring the same glamour game and just chatting streaming does, but to programming streams. Exciting projects, commentary, competitions, these are all things I want to implement. Unfortunately, that's far easier said than done. It's not like programming will miraculously become a source of pure entertainment overnight. Nevertheless, I will do my best.
