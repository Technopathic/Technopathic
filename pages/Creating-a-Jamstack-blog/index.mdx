Hey everyone! Ever wanted to start creating your own content on a blog, but wanted more than the usual platforms offered? Did you also not feel like figuring out the whole full-stack framework and database mess?

For this tutorial, we're going to use a new concept called the Jamstack, a modern way to build websites and apps that delivers better performance with less overhead. I love using the Jamstack, it's a great way to get started with web development for new coders and keeps the application lean, using only the necessary technologies.

## NextJS
NextJS is an amazing front-end JavaScript framework which uses ReactJS. We're using NextJS because we want our blog to generate static files. This means when we build our project, the output files will be pre-rendered HTML files which we will then upload to our production server. Speaking from experience, in most professional Front-end applications, we tend to use a Front-End framework, such as NextJS or Gatsby. Having Static or Server-Sided generation grants us a boost in performance and better SEO than plain old Client-Side ReactJS. 

## Tailwind
I've been using Tailwind quite often lately and I've gotta say, I am a fan. Essentially, Tailwind is a CSS framework which has all of our necessary CSS properties and values already defined and available for use. With Tailwind, we can easily and quickly style our blogging application without creating a bunch of CSS classes or worrying about styled-components.

## MDX
Naturally with any blog, you will need a way to write your blog posts. Adding a WYSIWG editor is a lot of work and usually requires some sort of data storage, so we're not going to do that. Meanwhile, constantly writing our posts in JSX wouldn't be ideal for someone unfamilar with coding and can easily become unmaintainable. We're going to meet in the middle and use a library called MDX, which allows us to use Markdown with JSX to create our post content. MDX automatically converts our Markdown to JSX components making your posts easier to read and write. 

## Vercel
We will be using Vercel to host our finished blog application. Vercel is perfectly optimized for NextJS and integrates well with Github. Essentially we connect our Github repo with Vercel and we're all set. Every push we make to Github will always be automatically pushed to our Vercel host. On a side note, I will also show you how to use Github Pages to host your blog application if you prefer that method. 

### Why these technologies?
I chose these technologies because my own website uses them. Most of these technologies I also use in my every day professional life and have improved the quality of my web development workflow significantly. Above all, I would personally say my main reasoning is based on documentation. Each of these technologies has outstanding documentation on their website and I highly recommend reading through it to gain a better insight into their features.

## Getting started
Now that we've got the explanations out of the way, let's begin by installing all of the libraries we need and configuring them. For this guide and all of my projects, I use Visual Studio Code (VSC) and the node terminal in VSC (ctrl/cmd + `), but you're free to use whatever text-editor and nodeJS terminal you prefer. 

We'll start with NextJS, which will also give us our folder structure and everything we need for starting our codebase.
```
npx create-next-app my-blog
```

Create-next-app is great for beginning your NextJS applications with the most minimal boilerplate code. For now, you can name your blog as "my-blog" and once it's done install the NextJS libraries, you can then run the recommended commands to ensure everything is working:
```
cd my-blog
npm run dev
``` 
You can then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view your new NextJS app. 
Once you're done, you can `ctrl+c` to stop the server and we will continue installing the rest of the libraries. 

We will now install Tailwind, which also requires two peer dependencies, `postcss` and `autoprefixer`.
```
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer --save
```

Then we will generate our tailwind and postcss config files. Luckily tailwind has a command to generate this for us. 
```
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This will generate two files, `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. You can use these files to extend Tailwind with custom themes and styles. You can find out more about these features on the Tailwind documentation.

Now is the perfect time to open your blog project in Visual Studio Code as we will begin writing code from here.

Since there may be many Tailwind styles that you will not use, it is best to remove unused styles from our pages and components during the production build. Let's add the file paths to our `tailwind.config.js` file inside of the `purge` option. 

```
purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
```

Now we need to include Tailwind into our CSS. Inside of `/styles/globals.css`, you will add these three lines to the top of the file:
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

These are Tailwind directives, which include all of the styles for Tailwind and are swapped out at build-time with all of the styles needed for your blogging application. 
We also include these styles in a CSS file so you can add your own CSS classes if you choose to do so. 

Finally, we will install MDX, which also needs very minimal configuration.
```
npm install @mdx-js/loader @next/mdx --save
```

In order to configure MDX, we need to create a `next.config.js` file in the root directory of our blog application. Once you have that file, you will need to add the following lines:
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/0.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={0} data={data}/>

This configuration tells NextJS to treat .js, .jsx, .md and .mdx files in the `pages` directory as actual pages which can be viewed. If you favor Typescript, you can also add "ts" and "tsx" to the `pageExtensions` array. 

Now if you were to run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` once more, everything should still be working normally. If all is well and you see the default NextJS page, then well done! We have completed the first step of our blogging application.
