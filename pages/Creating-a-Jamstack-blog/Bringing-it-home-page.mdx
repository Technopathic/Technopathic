## Bringing it home page
It's time for our home page. We've done a lot to get this point but thanks to creating our components, post, and actions, this will be the last JSX file we have to write. 

In your `/pages/index.js` file, delete everything and we will get started.

### Home Layout
For our home page, we are going to have a grid styled layout of our posts previews. Let's start by setting up the HTML layout.
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/28.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={28} data={data} />

The layout looks very empty? That's because our `Preview` component and Tailwind classes will handle the heavy lifting.

### Home styles
Let's use Tailwind to set up a grid layout and maximum width of the content. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/29.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={29} data={data} />

Like the `Header`, we're setting the maximum width of the content to `1024px` using `max-w-screen-lg`. Then we are using `grid` for a grid layout with a `gap` of `1.75rem` using `gap-7`. Tailwind has this neat feature where you can specify classes based on screen size. Notice `grid-cols-3` has `lg:` before it? We're specifying that the grid should be 3 columns, but only on large screens and above. Meanwhile, `md:grid-cols-2` specifies 2 columns for medium-sized screens (typically tablets), and there's no need to specify small screens as it will automatically default to 1 column. Lastly, we add `mx-auto` to center our grid `<main>` and add `mt-20` to create some space between our grid and the `Header`. 

### Home JavaScript
At the top of the file, we can now import our `Preview` component and our exported `posts` from our `actions.js` and use them in our `index.js` page. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/30.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={30} data={data} />

Then we will iterate over our `posts` and pass the data to the `Preview` component. 
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/31.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={31} data={data} />

We are now finished with our Home page. Here's the final code below:
![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/32.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={32} data={data} />

## Global styles
We cannot forget to add some additional classes to our `/styles/globals.css` file. If you've checked your blog post in your browser at this point, you'll notice that your `Headings` don't look too different from your `Paragraph` content. Let's fix that by styling our general `h1`, `h2`, and `p` elements.

![Code Snippet](/images/blog-with-nextjs-guide/33.svg)

<Show label="Code" content={33} data={data} />

Without going too in-depth into CSS, you can use this to help better style your MDX-parsed HTML elements. Now when you navigate to your post page, you should see some noticable differences between what is a `Heading` and a `Paragraph`. There are many more styles you can add to other HTML elements, I recommend experimenting to fit your brand.
