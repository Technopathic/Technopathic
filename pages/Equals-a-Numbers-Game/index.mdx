# Equals - A Numbers Game

<ScrollToTop />

![Cover Image](/images/equals-a-numbers-game/cover-image-large.png)

In Equals, you must create an equation to reach a target number within the time limit. Equals was made using HTML5/CSS3 and NextJS. The web app itself is currently hosted on Vercel.

While Equals is a very recent release, there’s quite a backstory to this game which spans through two generations leading up to this one. I’d like to take a moment to look back at those previous iterations and the lessons learned in developing and designing them.

## The Lore

The Equals game concept is nothing particularly new, the game itself is based on a British game show called “Countdown”, which happens to be based on a French show called “Des chiffres et des lettres”. The main difference between Equals and these games are the rules and how numbers are distributed. Oh, and also Equals isn’t a TV game show.

The first iteration of Equals was actually named “Mathica”, which I developed around five years ago. Around this time, 2048 was really quite popular and my first instinct was that people really love math games. Boy, was I wrong. Nevertheless, I worked on Mathica and even used the same colour palette from 2048 to make Mathica feel more familiar to my potential audience. Most of my efforts during development was spent ensuring the logic was correct and users would not be able to cheat the game. While functionally sound, the game itself was bland and could hardly be considered a game. I had no intention of monetizing Mathica at the time, so I didn’t bother putting in any effort into marketing. In fact, the game itself was hosted solely on my Github pages instead of on an actual website.

On the heels of Mathica, the next iteration of Equals (also called Mathica) was released two years later. Around this time, I had moved to Helsinki, Finland and began exploring new design concepts. Flat design and subtle gradients were the trend, so I redesigned Mathica (and created another game called “Upword”) with these ideas in mind.  Not only did I create a more modern looking Mathica, I also bought it’s own .app domain and created a logo to accompany the identity of the game. While I was undoubtedly happy with the design of the game, it still didn’t have many elements which would categorize it as a game. There were no interactive feedback loops, no audio, and no progression. While still functional and with a pleasant UI, the User Experience was still severely lacking. At least it made for a great portfolio piece.

It wouldn’t be until another two years when I began working on the third iteration of Mathica, now named Equals. I had chosen to rename the game in order to divert peoples’ attention from this being a “boring maths game” into a “fun numbers game”. It was time to introduce all of the missing UX elements and game design components. One of the biggest feedback comments I received from my few players of the previous iterations was “I thought I was good at math, but your game proved me wrong”. This made me realize the previous games were too difficult, even for adults. I wanted the third iteration to have a low threshold for entry and be playable for even children. With this in mind, I made it so Equals would start off easy, but progressively become more difficult as a player progressed in levels. I also made it so the user could visually see the results of their equations in real-time, a feature missing from the previous iterations until a user checked their answer.

## Design and Cuts

As for the design, I wanted to appeal to a large and wide audience, so I followed the trend of popular mobile games. Shiny buttons and bright colors as seen in games like Candy Crush were my inspiration. I also included a new splash screen and a start-menu with a gachapon machine style to emphasize the ideas of fun and interactivity. Necessary? Probably not, but it sparks interest. Buttons were now 3D, brightly multi-colored, and animated to have them be pushed down when pressed, with a subtle glow. I also included both a Completion screen and a Game Over screen to reward and encourage the player to continue, respectively. Additionally, I added a leveling system and an achievement system to further the idea of progression while playing Equals.

Aside from looking like a game, Equals also needed to sound like a game too. Pretty much every interaction and interactive feedback needed to have audio. I also had an overarching background music as well, an upbeat and happy tune. As it would happen, the total size of the audio files is larger than the actual game itself (640kb~).

Before moving onto the future ambitions of Equals, let’s take a look at what I’ve left on the cutting room floor.

The third iteration was originally planned to be a React-Native mobile app built with Expo. Unfortunately, I couldn’t use the full range of CSS3 properties to create all of the graphics I wanted. This would have left me with having to create SVGs of all of the game components (buttons, gacha, background, etc). Which I couldn’t be bothered to do. Same with animations.

Online and multiplayer features were also planned. Actually, I had finished developing the online ranked leaderboard and integrity checks for all game sessions. Lobbies and real-time multiplayer between a maximum of eight players was also near complete. I scrapped these game modes because they would involve me paying a monthly Firebase bill for a game I had no budget for. In retrospect, I would utilize Vercel serverless functions and Supabase as the back-end.

The last item cut from the game was the background music choices. My previous gameplay music choice would have been much darker and aggressive because it suited my tastes better. Really glad I went with something cuter.

## Future plans

My future scope for Equals is quite ambitious, I want to release Equals on many different platforms in at least thirty different languages. In order to achieve this, I’ve built Equals as a Web App, these are great. Not only is the web platform accessible on most devices, Equals is also a Progressive Web App, meaning it’s installable on mobile devices right from the official website. Additionally, I can use Capacitor and Electron to create hybrid Mobile and Desktop apps using the same codebase. As for language translation, that mainly comes down to how much I’m willing to invest in translation services. There are only about 250~ words to be translated, so it’s highly feasible. Accessibility is my number one goal with Equals, it may not be a game for everyone, but I want everyone to be able to enjoy it.

So there we have it, the not so secret past of Equals. I look forward to seeing the progress and growth to come. Who knows, maybe in another two years, we’ll see a fourth generation including the latest and greatest modern technologies. Come whatever may, Equals has become my favourite long-term project and I hope one day there’ll be a thriving community around the game supporting me as we journey together.
