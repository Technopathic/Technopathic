# My Experience with Coding Interviews [Part 1]

<ScrollToTop />

![Cover Image](/images/coding-interviews/cover-image-large.png)

I've been a software developer for almost ten years now, so I've had a chance to experience coding / technical interviews throughout a few industry paradigms. For this article, I will mainly be focusing on my experience within the last three years in Finland. I'd like to share my most notable experiences with you all and the typical interview archetypes they represent. I'll be starting with the worst style of coding interview and working my way up to the best one. Since each of these experiences takes me a while to write, this will be an on-going series. 

*As a forewarning, this post will contain explicit language as I recall some of my most unpleasant interview experiences.*

I will not be addressing the `Soft Interviews`. I'm quite good at soft interviews and normally don't have awful experiences with them. That being said, if there's interest in learning more about my experience with soft interviews let me know. 

## Coding Quizzes

By far the laziest form of skill assessment I have ever seen. When I say `Coding Quiz`, I'm mainly talking about multple-choice assessements. In my opinion, this is the absolute worst and doesn't fully assess the potential abilities of the person being interviewed. In many cases, these quizzes are also timed. Just to clarify how lazy these fucktards are, many of the hiring managers / technical advisors will simply grab questions from Hackerrank or Toptal and use them in their assessment process.

### This is a bad idea

Not everyone performs well under pressure, interviews are already nerve-wracking to begin with. By adding more stress to your potential employee, you've effectively demonstrated that you don't give a shit about your employees and will ensure they suffocate under their workload when grind hits. 

The assessment is bias towards the most generalized questions included in the quiz. In many cases developers don't use / focus on the technologies that they don't need. Quiz assessements do not reflect on your developer's ability to learn, debug, and grow. 

Imagine graduating University, being an intern, shadowing developers, then be rejected from the hiring process because you failed a 20min multiple-choice coding interview because the questions were haphazardly chosen or didn't make any sense in a real-world application. It's completely disrespectful to be judged on your efforts when the people evaluating you have not put forth any effort.

### The other side

Some degenerate recruiter might tell you "it's a way to tell if the person knows how to code" or "it's a way to tell if the developer can communicate". By doing the bare minimum, you have convinced yourself you've given maximum effort, yet have only achieved a false sense of evaluation. You know what's another way of determining both of these abilities? Talking to people. If your role is in recruitment and cannot talk to the people you want to hire, then you should quit your job, attach jumper cables to your genitals, and spare the world from ever having to see anymore of your feces-laced bloodline. 

Additionally, if you're looking for accuracy, checking their CV, looking at their Github, reviewing their past work experience. These are all ways to suppliment your half-assed method of determining if your potential hire knows how to code.

### My experience

I can recall one of these experiences in detail. It was a 20min multiple-choice quiz assessment for a startup here in Helsinki. There was no soft interview at first, just an immediate jump to the quiz. I took the quiz using my own laptop at home. Of course, I didn't pass. What could I demonstrate within this limited scope of 20min pre-determined answers to showcase my ability? I build applications, I left exams and quizzes a long time ago at school. 

After the assessment, I emailed the startup's technical advisor (let's call him "Aimo"). I informed them that they were making a foolish decision by not considering an in-person interview, their job description and evaluation shows a distinct lack of experience in hiring technical professionals, and developers in Finland are already sparse, so their chances of this method succeeding are quite slim. I also told them as a start-up they shouldn't hold themselves too high on a pedestal and meet their applicants. 

Granted, I was a bit preachier back then. But hey, I was feeling insulted and frustrated while job hunting, like most people usually are.

Aimo's response was to forward my email to their startup founder, let's call him "Kero". To which, Kero politely responded by claiming their startup is a "process company" and they "value my feedback". They had also stated that due to "limited resources" they cannot interview every possible candidate. My question is, if your product is a web service and the future of your company depends on it, would you not want to focus most of your resources towards finding a developer?

### Aftermath

Three years later, their startup never kicked off and doesn't exist anymore. I guess they never found a developer who would put up with their elitist bullshit. To that end, I would like to say Aimo should have been a cum stain on his mother's forehead, because his father missed the mark, just like he did. 

Coincidentally, Kero has a certificate from an AI course on a platform I built at my current job. Effectively proving that their assessment was garbage and I have developed something of worth. So, I'd like to formally invite Kero to suck my dick and, in the spirit of Easter, I'll dip my balls in m√§mmi so he can get a taste of home.
